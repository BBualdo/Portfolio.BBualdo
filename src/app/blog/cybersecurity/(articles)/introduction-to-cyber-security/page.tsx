          <p>You can&apos;t talk about learning cybersecurity without first understanding certain key concepts and how networks work. Even the best cop can&apos;t catch a criminal unless they know the area of operation at least as well as the criminal does. <span className="font-bold text-lightMatrixGreen">But what exactly is cybersecurity?</span></p>
          <p>In short, cybersecurity is a field focused on maintaining <span className="font-bold text-lightMatrixGreen">safety in cyberspace</span> ‚Äî that is, on the internet. Every day, countless attacks are carried out by &quot;the bad guys&quot; against &quot;the good guys&quot;. The outcome of these battles often depends on <span className="font-bold text-lightMatrixGreen">how
            secure the latter&apos;s networks are</span>.</p>
          <p>Positions in cybersecurity can be divided into two sides ‚Äî <span className="font-bold text-red-400">red</span> and <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">blue</span>. The job
            of the red side is to test security measures, stepping into the role of a &quot;bad guy&quot; to try to breach systems, steal data, and so on. These are known as <span className="font-bold text-red-400">penetration
            tests</span> because the goal is to penetrate the system. The blue side, on the other hand, takes a more <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">defensive
            approach</span> ‚Äî analyzing security measures, assessing risks, studying malware, preparing reports, and responding to attacks (sometimes in real time, like guards on digital walls).</p>
