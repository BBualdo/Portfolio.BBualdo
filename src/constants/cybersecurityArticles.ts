That‚Äôs still manageable, but now imagine replacing all the websites we know with their IP addresses. Not so simple anymore, is it? This is where DNS (Domain Name System) comes to the rescue. Just like a postal address points to a specific house, a domain name points to a specific IP address of the website we want to connect to.",

Some still cling to the good old XP, and honestly, who can blame them? A reliable classic.
